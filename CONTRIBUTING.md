### 4. Code Examples

#### Adding a New Framework Implementation
```python
# artificial_neural_network_MNIST_newframework.py

import new_framework as nf
import numpy as np
import time

# Follow the same structure as existing implementations
def create_model():
    """Create neural network model using NewFramework"""
    # Implementation here
    pass

def train_model(model, X_train, Y_train, epochs=500):
    """Train the model with timing and progress output"""
    # Implementation here
    pass

def evaluate_model(model, X_test, Y_test):
    """Evaluate model and return accuracy, predictions"""
    # Implementation here
    pass

# Include visualization and comparison functions
```

#### Adding Educational Features
```python
def visualize_learning_process(training_history):
    """
    Create educational visualizations showing:
    - Loss curves
    - Accuracy progression
    - Weight evolution
    - Gradient flow
    """
    # Implementation with clear educational value
    pass
```

## üéì Educational Standards

### Code Quality for Learning
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Choose readable code over optimized but complex code
- **Comments explain "why"**: Not just what the code does, but why it's needed
- **Progressive complexity**: Start simple, then add complexity
- **Consistent patterns**: Use similar patterns across implementations

### Mathematical Accuracy
- Ensure all mathematical formulas are correct
- Include references for complex concepts
- Explain mathematical intuition, not just implementation

### Framework Fairness
- Don't favor one framework over another
- Show strengths and weaknesses objectively
- Maintain similar complexity levels across implementations

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports
Include:
- Python version
- Operating system
- Framework versions
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Error messages

### Feature Requests
Include:
